 *      because failed-login events happen pre-authentication.
 *   2. the Paystack webhook (src/server/routes/paymentsWebhook.ts), because
 *      Paystack calls that endpoint directly with no session at all - the
 *      HMAC signature check is what authorizes it instead.
 *   3. inviting a team member by email (src/server/routes/
 *      businessMemberships.ts), because supabase.auth.admin.* is a
 *      privileged Auth API that only the service role can call at all - the
 *      route itself checks the caller's own role (Owner/Admin) before ever
 *      reaching this client, since RLS has no way to gate an Auth API call.
 *
 * Do NOT use this client for ordinary business data CRUD - that would defeat
 * the RLS guarantee that is the core security property of this app.
